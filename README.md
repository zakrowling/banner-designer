# Banner designer
The banner designer helps create and draft simple banners without needing extra software. Upload images from your computer, reposition them in the template and resize them by selecting the corners of the image in the design. Fill in the details and save the entire design or just the background image.

The banner designer uses Interact.js to resposition/resize banners and HTML2Canvas to save banners as jpegs.
